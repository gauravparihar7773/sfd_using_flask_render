Handling file upload in Flask is very easy. It needs an HTML form with its enctype attribute set
 to ‘multipart/form-data’, posting 
the file to a URL. The URL handler fetches file from request.files[] object and saves it to the desired location.

Each uploaded file is first saved in a temporary location on the server, before it is actually saved to its ultimate 
location. Name of destination file can be hard-coded or can be obtained from filename property of request.files[file] 
object. However, it is recommended to obtain a secure version of it using the secure_filename() function.

It is possible to define the path of default upload folder and maximum size of uploaded file in configuration settings
 of Flask object.
